        <h1>The Story</h1>
        <p>
          It all started on a lazy afternoon, while reminiscing about the countless
          classics I grew up watching in the 80s and 90s. I realized there wasn’t a
          simple, organized place to search for and store all these amazing films. And
          so, **Retro Reel** was born—a platform to help film enthusiasts rediscover,
          enjoy, and keep track of their favorite films from these legendary decades.
          After many nights of coding and watching old movies, we created a space where
          fans of retro cinema could come together and relive the magic of the past.
